### Description: 
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear").   [Download Flag](http://https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fb851c1858cc762bd4eed569013d7f00/flag "Download Flag")

### Solution: 
I have used Kali Linux VirtualBox to solve this solution. After downloading this file, I found out that this file is a text file. So, I have used Kali Terminal and only used the cat flag command.
